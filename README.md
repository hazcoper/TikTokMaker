# TikTokMaker
tool that will convert reddit comments into tiktok videos



This will consist of three parts:
    getting the comment
    text to speach
    generate image of the coment


the first version is done and is working, now need to make a ui to optmize the workflow


things to do:
    add ui
    make it separate the paragraphs when speaking
    make a repo with possible videos for the background
    make it grab the images automatically
    make it be able to generate the video automatically
    speed up the voice
        maybe this will only be possible by making the video faster
